Cabinet has called on all eligible voters to register online for the 2024 National and Provincial Elections. “The Electoral Commission (IEC) launched an online voter registration campaign on 20 February 2023 and appealed to the youth who are eligible to vote to register so that they can exercise their democratic right to vote,” Minister in the Presidency, Mondli Gungubele, said on Thursday. Addressing a media briefing in Pretoria on the outcomes of Wednesday's Cabinet meeting, Gungubele said voters must register where they reside and vote where they are registered. “Citizens already registered to vote are also encouraged to check their voters’ roll address, and update their address if they have moved since the last general elections." According a recent statement by the IEC, nearly 220 000 eligible South Africans have heeded the call to visit the Electoral Commission’s Voter Portal to register online to vote since the launch of a national campaign on 20 February 2023, in preparation for the 2024 National and Provincial Elections. South Africans aged 16 years and older, who have a South African identity document (ID), smart ID card or valid temporary ID are encouraged to use the Electoral Commission’s Voter Portal to register to vote for all future elections. To register, visit: https://registertovote.elections.org.za. The intensive two-week online voter registration campaign, themed 'Your Vote Is Your Voice', continues to feature on digital and traditional media until 3 March 2023. The campaign forms part of a multi-faceted year-long campaign by the Commission to encourage and facilitate eligible South Africans to register to vote. The campaign is aimed particularly at unregistered youth, so that they can vote in the 2024 National and Provincial Elections and all future elections. –SAnews.gov.za
