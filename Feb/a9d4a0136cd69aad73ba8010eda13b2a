Government has expressed appreciation to the radio industry for its unique role in promoting the identities of South Africans across cultures and languages, as well as fostering peace domestically and internationally. This as South Africa observed World Radio Day, which was celebrated under the theme “Radio and Peace,” on Monday, as 13 February is specifically set aside to raise awareness of the importance of radio. “Radio in particular is still one of the most accessible mediums in the country. During the dark days of Apartheid South Africa, radio was used as a revolutionary tool to keep the people informed of the struggle being waged against the crime against humanity. “For example, radio played a positive role in society during the anti-apartheid struggle.  Radio Freedom in South Africa used to communicate and send messages to people on the ground. People would gather together in homes who had radios just to hear the broadcast,” Minister in the Presidency Mondli Gungubele said. In South Africa, radio is a very powerful communication medium, which is easily accessible even in the rural parts of the country. It brings people from all walks of life together through its role of entertaining, educating and sharing important information. “Similarly, it played a crucial role in fostering democracy and expressing our diversity in this country. The media, such as radio, continues to shape opinions and perceptions and influence public discourse. “Radio holds particular importance in framing narratives on issues or events and has great power to influence people.  In a post-pandemic environment, radio, like other media, has a critical role to play in contributing towards social cohesion, peace and nation building,” Gungubele said. Radio stations are among the key stakeholders of government, as they disseminate key information about government programmes of action and opportunities that the public can use to improve their lives. – SAnews.gov.za
