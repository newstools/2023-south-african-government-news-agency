As the Vaal Dam water capacity continue to decrease, the Department of Water and Sanitation has closed another sluice gate on Monday, resulting in six gates remaining open. This comes after two sluice gates closed on Saturday, as water levels in the Vaal Dam system subsided following days of overflowing and flooding due to heavy rains. In a statement, Department spokesperson, Wisane Mavasa said the Vaal Dam is experiencing continuous decrease in water capacity, currently sitting at 108%. “The water levels at Bloemhof Dam, also on decline, with the dam level at 105%, and the water discharge is being reduced gradually from 2800 m3/s [cubic metre per second] to 2400m3/s by this afternoon. “In the Orange River, the Gariep Dam is also sitting at around 108.84%, and the releases into the Orange River are 1222.45m3/s.  At the Vanderkloof dam, water levels are at 108% and outflow releases are 1318m3/s,” Mavasa said. Mavasa added that water levels at the Lower Orange River and Lower Vaal River remain high and are expected to respond to the reduced flows from both the upstream Orange and Vaal rivers only later in the week. “The Department of Water and Sanitation’s Hydrological Monitoring and Forecasting System continues to closely monitor the water flow in these rivers and dams, as well as other water courses across the country,” Mavasa said. – SAnews.gov.za
